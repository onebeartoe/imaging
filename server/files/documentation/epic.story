As a photo enthusiast,
I need a digital photo album system,
so that I can view images hosted on my network.

US0-AC0 - An image server endpoint providing recursive directory listings exists and
US0-AC1 - an image server endpoint providing random images exists and
US0-AC2 - an image server endpoint supports PyPortal image format and 
US0-AC3 - there is an HTML client for the random image endpoint.
