As a image resizer user,
I need an overwrite parameter,
so that it is explicitly expressed that existing files should be overwritten.

Acceptance Criteria:
Output files are only overwritten if the 'overwrite' parameter is set to true and,
if the overwrite parameter is false and the output file already exists then an exception is thrown.
