As a user of ImageResizer,
I need the window configuration persisted between runs,
so that I don't have resize and move the application window every time it is run.

Acceptance Criteria

The window location is stored upon exiting the application and
the saved window location is restored on application startup and
the window size is stored upon exiting the application and
the saved window size is restored on application startup.
