As a AnimaedGifs developer, 
I need the test output files moved to the target directory, 
so git does not show them as as untracked files under the source directory.

Acceptance Criteria

After execution of unit tests, no output files are located under the src/ directory and
Runing 'git status' shows no untracked files under the src/ directory.
